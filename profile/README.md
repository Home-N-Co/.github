## Presentation

This project is made by Computer Science students for an IoT course.

**Home&Co** is a project using **ESP32** dev boards and a **Raspberry Pi 3B+** to monitor, control and automate home appliances like the lights, heaters, front door, water valves for watering plants, etc.

Its objectives are to provide **security**, **control**, **comfort**, **peace of mind** and **energy saving** to your home.

### 1. Security

Our front door device will control the access policy of the front door of your home:
- **RFID** sensor needing a **badge** to open the door
- **bell button** ringing the bell and **notifying you on your phone**
- **locking mechanism** controlled **remotely** (no need to give keys to anybody)
- **presence detector** to **monitor** the activity in front of the door
- **house locking function** to **automatically turn off** all the lights and use all presence detectors as **intrusion detectors**

### 2. Control

You can use the website to **remotely control at any time** the _lights_, the _door_, the _heaters_ and the _watering of plants_.

You have the **full control of your house** from any device.

### 3. Comfort

You can **automate the heaters** to activate at any time of the day, to find a warm house we coming back from a hike, vacation or any activity.

### 4. Peace of mind

You won't have to go through your check list three times or ask your neighbour to water your plants before going out!

You can **monitor your house from any device** using the website in **real time**: from the _presence detectors_ to the _lights_, _heaters_, _humidity of the plants_ and _temperature of any room_.

### 5. Energy saving

No need to keep heating your home when you're not there!

You'll be able to control and monitor the **heaters** remotely and according to your needs and presence at home.

You'll also be able to **monitor the energy of specific high consumption appliances** with our **smart power outlet** and control them remotely, and even give them schedules to be working or not.
